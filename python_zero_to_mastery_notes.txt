pep = python enhancement proposals ,, community which standardize ways to write code..pep8, style guide for python codes
anaconda contains all tools needed for data science and machine learning
jupyter notebook helps visualize easily
everything in python is an object
python is an object oriented programming language because everything is built on class keyword and methods are used
to perform actions on them
an object has methods and attributes that can be accessed with the .method
we can create our own datatypes with diff attributes and methods
oop
oop is a paradigm - it helps us manage our codes, helps structure codes in a way that is easier to maintain,
extend and rewrite. as codes get bigger, it helps us organize millions of codes
code real life objects
we can create our own class using the class keyword then the name of the class in camelcase(capitalize each word)
#instantiate means creating instance(object) from a class
a class is a blueprint for creating objects, it has properties and methods
The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.
when writing code, try to be DRY(do not repeat yourself)
when a  function doesnt return anything, we get none
one piece of code, one blueprint(class) is used to create multiple objects at different positions in memory,
they are distinct
oop help us add functionalities and mimic the real world
helps us write codes that are repeatable, organized, and memory efficient
attributes are dynamic pieces of data, they are unique to specific objects
Class object attribute is diff from regular attribute, its not dynamic and its in the same line as the method
note that self refers to the class
init is used when we want to create a custom object i.e. instantiate
creating a method for the class
there are three methods
1. instace method- the normal one that uses self
2. class method use cls as the first parameter in def the method
it can be used without instantiating
3. static method- this works as the above but doesnt the cls keyword and hence doesnt have access to the class
this is used when we don't care about the class attribute
Instance Methods: The most common method type. Able to access data and properties unique to each instance.
Static Methods: Cannot access anything else in the class. Totally self-contained code.
Class Methods: Can access limited methods in the class. Can modify class specific details.

all of this (oop) is to create our datatype that models the real world. help structure our code

four pillars of oop
1. encapsulation - binding of data and functions that manipulate the data to an object to keep all in a box
so users, codes and machines can interact with easily. the data and functions are the attributes and methods
functionalities are encapsulated for use(.methods)
